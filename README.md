These are my Javascript bots for my foodbot support server

Hello! This is one of my old bots. Anyway, let me explain!

.env is where you put your bot token. You should keep this token private at all times.

LICENSE - I'm pretty sure you all know what this is. If you don't, just read it.. I'm not gonna explain.

index.js - Where you put new commands and such; this .JS file creates the client.

package.json - The packages required for the bot to run.

server.js - This is for keeping the bot up.

You can do anything that is listed in the Permissions category in the LICENSE file.
